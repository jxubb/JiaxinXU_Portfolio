A showcase of my projects and my abilities.

# [Automatic Human Orientation Recognition with Detectron2](https://github.com/jxubb/Automatic-Human-Orientation-Recognition-with-Detectron2)
* Reformed Detectron2 to detect human orientation in the context of determining the correct orientation (from 0, 90, 180, and 270 degrees) of a human image/photo.
* Built a web application to deploy the human orientation detection model with FastAPI.
* Made the FastAPI application to a docker image and ran it as a docker container.

# [Pothole Detection with Deep Learning Based Frameworks](https://github.com/jxubb/UAlberta-Multimedia-Master-Program--Pothole-Detection-with-Dash-Cam)  
* Coded multiple object detection frameworks with TensorFlow, containing You Only Look Once (YOLO), Fast R-CNN, Mask R-CNN and Single Shot Detector (SSD).
* Preprocessed different types of raw data, including images, json files and text files, using cv2, json, LabelImg.
* Designed and conducted experiments to compare the performance of the above frameworks with f-score, mean Average Precision (mAP) and Frames Per Second (FPS).

# [Outline Fusion for Human Segmentation from a Static Camera](https://github.com/jxubb/UAlberta-Multimedia-Course-Program--Human-Segmentation-with-YOLACT)
* Generated dataset with static camera and created COCO-style object detection annotation files for the dataset. 
* Combined object detection network and background subtraction method to extract human outline and achieved real-time human segmentation.
* Compared our method with state-of-the-art instance segmentation network and evaluated our method using FPS and mAP over different Intersection over Union (IoU).
