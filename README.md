# Pothole Detection with Deep Learning Based Frameworks  
* Coded multiple object detection frameworks with TensorFlow, containing You Only Look Once (YOLO), Fast R-CNN, Mask R-CNN and SSD.
* Preprocessed different types of raw data, including images, json files and text files, using cv2, json, LabelImg.
* Designed and conducted experiments to compare the performance of the above frameworks with f-score, mean Average Precision (mAP) and Frames Per Second (FPS).
